# Collatz Conjecture
 A programme that tries to disprove Collatz conjecture
Starting from 2^68, every integer is tested for a pattern. It is theorized that when an integer is subjected to the following, that a pattern is always formed:
If the number is even, divide by 2.
If the number is odd, times the number by 3 and add 1 to the result.
This should result in a loop of the numbers 4-2-1 infinitely, or should it?

There is reason to believe that the numbers tested have just been too small to break the cycle. This programme aims to find a number that can disprove Collatz conjecture.
